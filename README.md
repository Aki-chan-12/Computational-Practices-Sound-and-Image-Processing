Project 1: Vector Abstraction.

Written in Proccesing. 

I have made a sketch that creates a colour image resembling a specific 20th century abstract artist. 

While starting with the code, I have decide to use 2 artist in my work. So I connected them.

These artists are: 
1. Wassily Kandinsky "Homage to Grohmann";

2. Gerhard Richter "Abstract Painting 599", 1986.

Wassily Kandinsky "Homage to Grohmann":
His work is engaged on me because of the shape styles and their positions. 

Gerhard Richter "Abstract Painting 599"
He has used an interesting colour pallette, so decide to add it too. 

While I was writing my code I drew some shapes from "Homage to Grohmann". These were triangle, circle, square and two lines. I have colored them and made a correct positions. After, I played with the moving ellipse to make moving variables in interesting shape. 
Also, I have used an image from erhard Richter "Abstract Painting 599" to visulate his colours into my sketch by using ellipse shape and pixels structure code knowledge.


My sketch included the demonstration of:
- vector graphics
- pushMatrix/popMatrix
- a color palette expressed as color variables (that means: store the various colours you use in the sketch as color variables, rather than defining them every time you use them)

Here is a video of my project 1 work:
